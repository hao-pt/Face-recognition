# Face-recognition

## Introduction
This is case study in Pattern recognition subject. We study Face Recognition At a Distance (FRAD) but there are a lot of challenges such as: Optics and Light Intensity, Exposure Time and Blur, Image Resolution and Pose, Illumination and Expression. Also, FRAD need to set up a system that has several cameras like wide field of view (WFOV) and narrow field of view (NFOV). This project is based on this article: Wheeler, F.W., Weiss, R.L., Tu, P.H.: Face recognition at a distance system for surveillance applications. In: BTAS (2010)

There are 2 demo:
- Demo1: It used for presentation at class. We trained model with small dataset. We used Single Shot Detector (SSD) model with ResNet architecture for detecting object. More detail, please check it at Demo1.
- Demo2: We improve the performance for detecting face at long distance and various scale, light condition. We used Multi-task CNN for detecting step. This model was trained on large dataset which was generated by us. This dataset cover some characters in Avenger: Infinity war movie such as: Black window, Black Panther, Bruce Banner,... Why we choose them because Avenger video has a lot of point of views, scales and light conditions. More detail, please check it at Demo2.

Report documents (Team H3 - 1612174_1612269_1512211 - Final) includes: report for demo1, demo2 and for FRAD system.

## Basic procedures:

In demo1, we use SSD for detecting object. We also use image enhancement resolution likes Ganerative Aversarial Network (GAN) for doing this task. Particularly, we just enhance image resolution for image with low resolution. We didn't integrate this process into our system because GAN take a long time to enhance image resolution.
In demo2, we use Multi-task CNN for detecting object. Literally, Multi-task CNN is better SSD because it can capture object (face) in various scales, light conditions, head views nd even occlusion.
