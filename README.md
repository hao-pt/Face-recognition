# Face-recognition

## Introduction
This is case study in Pattern recognition subject. We study Face Recognition At a Distance (FRAD) but there are a lot of challenges such as: Optics and Light Intensity, Exposure Time and Blur, Image Resolution and Pose, Illumination and Expression. Also, FRAD need to set up a system that has several cameras like wide field of view (WFOV) and narrow field of view (NFOV). This project is based on this article: Wheeler, F.W., Weiss, R.L., Tu, P.H.: Face recognition at a distance system for surveillance applications. In: BTAS (2010)

In demo, there are 2 demo:
- Demo1: It used for presentation at class. We trained model with small dataset. We used Single Shot Detector (SSD) model with ResNet architecture for detecting object. 
- Demo2: We improve the performance for detecting face at long distance and various scale, light condition. We used Multi-task CNN for detecting step. This model was trained on large dataset which was generated by us. This dataset cover some characters in Avenger: Infinity war movie such as: Black window, Black Panther, Bruce Banner,... Why we choose them because Avenger video has a lot of point of views, scales and light conditions.
